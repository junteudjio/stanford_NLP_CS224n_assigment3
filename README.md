## Synopsis

This repo is my implementation of the coding questions of assignment3 of Stanford University class:
[CS224n](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/): Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

In this assignment we have implemented the followings using python + tensorflow:
- A window-based named entity recognizer(NER)
- A RNN/GRU-based NER.

Ih the question 3 of this assignment we consider a GRU as an automata and analyzed its toogling and latching behaviors.
- You can find my (typed, correct and more detailed) solutions here:  [CS224n_written_sections_solutions](https://github.com/junteudjio/stanford_NLP_CS224n_written_sections_solutions)
